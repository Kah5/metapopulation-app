# metapopulation-app
This repository contains code for a metapopulation Rshiny app developed for Conservation Biology 406/506R

# Metapopulation exercise and student questions:
1.	Open the Rshiny App to explore metapopulation models
https://kellyheilman.shinyapps.io/metapopulation/

2.	Change pi and pe from their default levels. How is the equilibrium fraction of patches (f) influenced by changing pi and pe?

3.	Set the probability of extinction, pe, equal to 1, and the probability of colonization, pi, equal to 0.9. Why has the population persisted in Levin’s model, considering that all patches are doomed to extinction? 

4.	Set the fraction of patches occupied to 0.5, the pi = 0.5, pe = 0.5. Describe the differences between simulations with Levins model, the propagule rain model, and the core-satellite model after 50 years. 

Which model has a higher fraction of patches occupied? Why do you think this is? Which model has the lower fraction of patches occupied? Why? Which has a large spread in the simulations, and why?
The following scenarios are meant to illustrate the potential effects of loss of connectivity and habitat fragmentation on the sky island black bear metapopulation. Black bears are listed as an endangered species in Mexico, but not in the US. 

5.	Scenario 1: The sky island black bears are able to move freely throughout the Mexican and US sky islands and colonize unoccupied habitat with a probability of 0.4 and have a local patch extinction rate of 0.3 Using Levin’s model, 25 simulations, and 0.7 as your initial proportion of patches occupied by black bears, what would happen to a metapopulation of black bears in the sky islands if Pe = 0.3 and Pi = 0.4? Give a range of the proportion of patches occupied. 

6.	Scenario 2: Construction of the border wall between Mexico and the US  has limited movement of black bears between habitat patches (site), reducing the colonization rate to 0.16. In the absence of other changes, describe what would happen over time under levin’s metatpopulation model. What happens under the propagule rain model? And the core-satellite model? Can you explain why these are different?
Extra thinking: Which model(s) might be the most appropriate for predicting the proportion of patches occupied in the Mexican sky islands?
7.	Scenario 3: The construction of the border wall not only limited movement, but resulted in habitat destruction, which contributed to ongoing land-use change and habitat destruction. Let’s say that 50% of black bear habitat is destroyed (set Habitat destruction rate = 0.5), colonization rates stay at 0.2, and extinction rates stay at 0.3. How does the 50% habitat desctruction affect the persistence of black bear populations in the sky islands over time? About how many years does the black bear metapopulation have left under this scenario? What about with no habitat loss?
